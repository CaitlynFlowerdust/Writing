# My Translation (English)
**[Intro]**

What is rightfullness?

What is stupidity?

I'll show you all just what the fuck they truly are!

**[Verse 1]**

I was an honor student from so young,

But before I knew it I had grown so much.

My train of thoughts that were sharp as a knife,

Which I did not have on hand at that time.

But I'm not having that much fun!

Something must be missing!

These troubles better have someone who can be blamed!

I just get more confused with each passing day...

**[Pre-Chorus]**

Well, is that so, huh?

Understanding all the latest of trends,

Checking the stock market heading to work,

Joining a company with pure spirit,

These are the rules for us compliant workers!

**[Chorus]**

Haa? Shut up, shut up, shut your mouth!

I'm healthier than most people like to think!

You are just too damn normal,

To understand a being like me, perhaps!

Ah, you are such a match,

Perfect for these mediocre and dull melodies.

Shut up, shut up, shut your mouth!

I think differently, so there is no problem! Just leave me be!

**[Verse 2]**

That said, I am an exemplary girl.

So actually punching someone? No thank you!

But if I pointed my muzzle of sharp words,

To your head and fired, would that be okay?

Ah! Wouldn't that be so insane? I just can't stop myself!

Moaning and groaning, right until the day you die!

My spirit twists into something of a sadist.

**[Pre-Chorus]**

I'm fucking tired!

Pouring the drinks, over and over, filling the glasses so empty.

Take out the skewer, so it's easier, for everyone to begin eating.

Pay the check, ordering before all else.

These are the unwritten social manner rules!

**[Chorus]**

Haa? Shut up, shut up, shut your mouth!

Just close your stinking mouth, can't stand it anymore!

The spokesperson for our age, is none other than me, do you fucking understand?!

I'm just so damn fed up,

Of all these rehashed, rephrased, pointless things, parodies!

Shut up, shut up, shut your mouth!

Why don't you just draw an X on that, fat, ugly ass face?!

**[Bridge]**

Shut up, shut up, shut your mouth.

Shut up, shut up, shut your mouth.

I am the one you call a fucking genius!

**[Chorus]**

Shut up, shut up, shut your mouth!

I'm healthier than you fuckers seem to think!

You are too fucking normal,

To understand a fucked up person like me, perhaps?!

Ahh, so fucking boring...

How many times do I listen to your memories??

Shut up, shut your fucking mouth!

I might be as bad as all of you, but hey,

I don't care, no, it's no problem, yeah!
