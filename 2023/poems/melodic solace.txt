MELODIC SOLACE
---
In the quiet hours of the night,
When shadows merge and dreams take flight,
I find my solace in the gentle hum,
Of melodies that softly strum.

Within the notes, a refuge lies,
Where the world's chaos slowly dies,
In music's embrace, I'm free to be,
A soul unburdened, wild and free.

A violin weeps with mournful grace,
Tears of longing on its face,
Yet in its sorrow, I find release,
A balm for my heart, a sense of peace.

The piano's keys, they dance and sing,
A symphony of life's awakening,
In each chord struck, I find my way,
To a brighter, more hopeful day.

A voice, a song, a sweet refrain,
Carries me through joy and pain,
With every lyric, I am found,
In the sacred silence of the sound.

So, let the music fill the air,
Banish troubles, banish despair,
For in its arms, I'm never alone,
Finding solace in its gentle tone.
