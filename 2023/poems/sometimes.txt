SOMETIMES
---
Sometimes, I find myself daydreaming.
It could be at school,
At work,
Or at home.
It could be on the bus,
Or mid-conversation on the phone.
What do I dream about?
It really depends.
On my feelings, thoughts,
Whether the day has begun or is at its end.
Sometimes I'm a traveller,
Brave and adventurous.
Sometimes I'm an artist,
Skilled and dexterous.
No matter who I am,
No matter the time,
I always have to return,
To this lonely world of mine.
I'm left with a bittersweet taste,
Having to carry on with my mundane life.
But always, forever,
I have the dreams that await.
