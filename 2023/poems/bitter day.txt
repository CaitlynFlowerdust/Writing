BITTER DAY
---
It was a bitter day.
Snow was falling,
Painting the hills pure white.
My child, Alexis,
Throwing snowballs in delight.

Beneath a gray and wintry sky,
With rosy cheeks and gleaming eyes,
Alexis danced in the snowy fray,
A picture of pure, unbridled play.

As I watched my child's carefree glee,
The world's bitterness started to flee.
In her laughter, I found a way,
To chase my worries and fears away.

The bitter day, now bittersweet,
Brought warmth to my heart, oh so fleet.
For in Alexis's joyful display,
I found hope on that bitter day.
